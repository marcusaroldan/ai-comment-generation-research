#### What is this repository?
Contained within this repo are the final results of a semester long research project about the application of AI and Large Language Models for use in automatic comment generation for arbitrary source code. These documents underwent multiple rounds of peer- and self-review and act as a sample of my writing capabilities in the technical realm. 

##### DECOM Annotated Bibliography: a brief look at the state of research in September / October 2023 with respect to automatic comment generation techniques.
##### DECOM Memo: a sample internal memorandum which makes recommendations following the findings of the annotated bibliography.
##### DECOM Article: a public facing article, repackaging the findings from the annotated bibliography with respect to a public audience.
